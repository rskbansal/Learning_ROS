## Installing the right Operating System
Robotics Development relies heavily on **Linux**. It is recommended to install [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/). You can either dual boot your computer or install it in a virtual machine.<br><br>
If you are a **Windows** user, it is best to dual boot your computer. You can use tools like [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/) for creating a bootable USB. If you are using a virtual machine, you can use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).<br><br>
If you are a **MacOS** user, it is not a viable option to dual boot your computer. It is recommended that you use [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) and install the ARM image of Ubuntu.
